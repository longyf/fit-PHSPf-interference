# fit-PHSPf-interference

2018/3/5:

A test fit.
Try to solve problem of fit.
A simultaneous fit considering PHSP factors and interference between signal and 3-boby background.

Just copy the codes from pee, which means the PHSP factors have not been considered.

Only the constructive solution.

2018/3/6:

Now the constructive and destructive solutions have all been considered.
The PHSP factors (p-wave) have also been considered.

PHSP factor + interference : likelihood < interference : likelihood
PHSP factor : likelihood < no PHSP factor : likelihood

The fit considering PHSP factors and interference is better than that only considering PHSP factors.
Still, no PHSP factor/interference is the best.
